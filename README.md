# Insights About Airbnb In Hawaii For Visitors
Hawaii is one of the most popular choices for vacation. Airbnb is such a wonderful option for visitors to find the most comfortable HOME in Hawaii. For those who are planning the trip, there are a few things that are definitely good to know before making a reservation at Airbnb.
 
The source is the open data shared by Airbnb available at [Inside Airbnnb site](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html). This project is based on the **CRISP-DM** ([CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/)) methodology for analysis.

## What You Will Get From This Project
+ The cheapest time to visit Hawaii is August to October. As most people go to Hawaii in winter, especially during the holidays, you will need to pay much more than usual. 
+ There are plenty of Airbnb available in the Maui and Honolulu islands. Airbnb in Kauai island charges more than other islands. 
+ Neighborhood plays a key role in determining the price. Other generic factors about the listing also affect the price in many ways, such as bedrooms, bath, accommodates, room type, etc. The higher scores of the listings definitely provide evidence for the higher price.
